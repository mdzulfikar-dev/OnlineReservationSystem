This project is an Online Reservation System built using Java and MySQL. It provides users with the ability to manage train reservations by performing key operations such as adding new reservations, deleting existing ones, and viewing all reservation records. The application is structured around a main class named Task1, which also contains two nested classes: the user class for handling user-related details and the PnrRecord class for managing reservation data.

To run the system, the database connection must be configured first. This involves updating the URL in the main method with the correct MySQL database name, username, and password. After the configuration, the program can be compiled using Task1.java and executed from the command line.

Once executed, the program presents a menu-driven interface where users can select different options, including inserting a reservation, deleting a reservation, displaying all reservations, or exiting the application. The design ensures that users can interact with the system in a simple and efficient way while all data is securely stored in the MySQL database.

Contributions to this project are encouraged and welcomed. Developers may propose improvements, report issues, or submit pull requests to enhance the functionality and overall quality of the system.
